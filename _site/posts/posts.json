Cannot compare the data of each city well.\r\nThe first graph: annotate\r\nAlthough the graph is marked name of top five cities, it does not show the exact number of deaths in the five cities.\r\n1.2 Aesthetic\r\nThe first graph:\r\nOn the y-axis are the names of 44 cities, which are too complicated.\r\nComments are too focused and don’t provide useful information.\r\nThe choice to use dots as shape leaves too much white space throughout the chart.\r\n2.0 Alternative Design\r\nThe proposed design is as follows.\r\n\r\n2.1 Clarity\r\nThe first graph:\r\nUse the appropriate chart type. Use the map as the graph background and add dots of the cities cumulative deaths on the map.\r\nChange the title of the graph: “Cities with the number of cumulative deaths at 30th June 2021, DKI Jakarta”.\r\nSet the number of cumulative deaths as the color and size of circles in the graph to help readers to compare the cumulative deaths of cities.\r\nAdd the districts of DKI Jakarta as the filter, so we can compare the difference cumulative deaths of different districts. And also connect to the second graph.\r\nUse the number of cities cumulative deaths and names of cities as the label to help readers compare.\r\nThe second graph:\r\nChange the title of the graph: “Average number of cumulative positive cases per district at 30th June 2021, DKI Jakarta”.\r\n2.2 Aesthetic\r\nThe first graph:\r\nUse the appropriate chart type. Use the map as the graph background and add dots of the cities cumulative deaths on the map. It will be easy to read.\r\nSet the number of cumulative deaths as the color and size of circles. Don’t leave too much space in the graph.\r\nUse the number of cities cumulative deaths and names of cities as the label.\r\n3.0 Proposed Visualization\r\nPlease view the interactive visualization on Tableau Public here.\r\n4.0 Step-by-Step Guide\r\nNo\r\nStep\r\nAction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
